# Retail Lockbox, Inc. Assessment

### Applicant Name
Morgan Brockman

### Program Assumptions
* Program assumes no numbers separated by commas. (Ex: 300,200 read as 300 and 200, rather than 300200).
* Program assumes no numbers exceed size allowed by int and float datatypes.

### Time Estimate
Estimated just under an hour to complete.  
If I had more time I would probably do some more testing. I haven't really thoroughly tested all the exception cases.
