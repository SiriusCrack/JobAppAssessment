# Job App Assessment

### Applicant Name
Morgan Brockman

### Program Assumptions
* Program assumes no numbers separated by commas. (Ex: 300,200 read as 300 and 200, rather than 300200).
* Program assumes no numbers exceed size allowed by int and float datatypes.
* Program also assumes it is being run on a machine similar to mine, running .NET 7.0.7 with C# 11.0, as no other setups were tested.

### Time Estimate
Estimated just under an hour to complete.  
If I had more time I would probably do some more testing. I haven't really thoroughly tested all the exception cases.
